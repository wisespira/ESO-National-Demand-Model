<p align="center">
This project uses machine learning to create a predictive model for England and Wales national energy demand. The model is currently happly sitting with an average accuracy of 92%. The data used includes historical ND (national demand) data gathered from the National Grid ESO, as well as Londons daily avarage temperature scraped from weather.com to make its predictions. There is still much work to be done and as such this readme conatins both an account of the project as well notes for further reaseach.

<h2 align="center">Data Gathering</h2>

England and Wales histoical ND was gathered from National Grid ESO's data portal (https://data.nationalgrideso.com/demand/historic-demand-data). For simplicity, only the 2019 and 2020 set was used. The data came split into 48, 30 minute periods which comprised 1-days information on ND. <br>

Gathering large ammounts of historical weather information proved difficult, as such only the London daily average temperature data was added. This data was scraped from 'The Weather Channel' (https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/monthly/) and then cleaned in excel (see 'ESO and Weather Data/data from weather.com.xlsx' ).<br>

To combine the two data sets the ND was averaged for each day then the weather data was joined. <br>

Weekday/weekend data was added to the data set with a python function by looping through the set appending 1 for weekdays and 0 for weekends. An ajusted copy of the 2019 data was also added inwich all data was sifted up one day. The reasoning for the ajusted copy was an assumption that day of the week would be more relivent then the date. <br>

To begin with it was usfull to just have a brows through the data. The avarage daily demand was right skewed, posibly due to infrequent events like holidays/sporting events or to the short period of the year people where require heating, it may even be due to the data not featureing the full year or somthing else entirly.

The Average ND throughout the year gave some insight into the right skew showing a strong potential link between ND colder months and seasions. Anouther very interesting feature is the pattern of one off low ND followed by a few days of high ND.

  </p>  

To maybe gain insight into some of the observations It was usfull to compare some of the other data for similar trends. Although the two data sets looked near identical the weekdays did have a notably higher upper quartile giving weekdays a bigger impact on the right skew. It will be nessisary to beak the data down into days to find further insight.

The assumption proved correct that the days of the week were more relivent in general. However, It would be interesting to look for dates which the calender aligned set did better in, this may highlight other important elements.  

<a name="Feature-selection"></a>
<h3 align="center">Feature Selection</h3>
All veriables were corrilation and one-way ANOVA tested against the 2020 ND. From the results show below, all but the weelday/weekend veriable were shown to have predictive qualities. <br>  <br>

Although both '2019 ND' and '2019 ND Ajusted' were explanatory variables to remove any potential multicollinearity problems only the 2019 Ajustend was used as it had the higher corilation.
